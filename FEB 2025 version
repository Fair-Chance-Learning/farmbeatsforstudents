Welcome to the FarmBeats for Students hands-on Activity 1.1!

In this activity, you will build a soil moisture monitoring system using MakeCode.

Materials Needed: 

A micro:bit (V2), USB Connector, micro:bit Battery Pack, Soil, Container, 2  Nails, Water, 2 Alligator Clips 

## Displaying the measured moisture level
Let's get started! First, we will create some code to measure values. 

We want to show the moisture level in the soil as a graph of values that are collected over time. 
To do this, from the Toolbox on the left side of the screen, select the ``||led:Led||`` tray and drag the ``||led:plot bar graph||`` block inside the ``||basic:forever||`` block. 

**Click Next. **

```blocks
basic.forever(() => {
    led.plotBarGraph()
})
```

## Assigning the measured value to the graph

To measure the moisture in the soil, we need to read the voltage on pin **P0**. 

From the advanced menu, select the ``||pins:Pins||`` tray, and drag the ``||pins:analog read pin||`` inside the first ``0`` of the ``||led:plot bar graph||`` you set in the previous step.

```blocks
basic.forever(() => {
    led.plotBarGraph(
        pins.analogReadPin(AnalogPin.P0),
        0
    )
})
```

## Setting the maximum value to the graph

The values returned from **P0** will range between ``0`` (no current) and ``1023`` (maximum current). Since we will have no values greater than ``1023``, let's set the maximum value of the graph y axis to ``1023``. To set the maximum value, click inside the remaining ``0`` of your ``||led:plot bar graph||`` block and type in ``1023``.

```blocks
basic.forever(() => {
    led.plotBarGraph(
        pins.analogReadPin(AnalogPin.P0),
        1023
    )
})
```

## Assemble the Sensor
Now that we have created the code to measure the values, we need to assemble the sensor.

Connect an alligator clip to the **3V ** pin. Connect the other end of the alligator clip to a nail and insert the nail into the soil.

Connect an alligator clip to the **P0** pin. Connect the other end of the alligator clip to the other nail and insert the nail into the soil.


## Download your program to the micro:bit

Once your micro:bit is connected, you can easily move programs from MakeCode to your device. Here are the steps to get setup:

1. Connect your micro:bit to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Clicking on the three dots next to the "Download" button and choosing "Connect Device".
3. Follow the instructions to choose your micro:bit. 
4. The program will be transferred to the micro:bit and will start running automatically.

## Let's experiment!
Insert the nails into both the wet and dry soil. 

Observe and record your findings. 

## Using the "A" Button 

In the previous steps, the values are displayed on the micro:bit screen as a graph, so we have only a rough idea of what the soil moisture values are due to the size of the screen.

In the ``||Logic:Logic||`` tray, drag the ``||logic:if true then||`` block into the ``||basic:forever||`` block under the ``||led:plot bar graph||`` block you already have in place. Then, from the ``||input:Input||`` tray, drag the ``||Input:button A is pressed||`` block in between the **if** and **then**, replacing the ``||logic:true||`` value. 

```blocks
basic.forever(() => {
    led.plotBarGraph(
        pins.analogReadPin(AnalogPin.P0),
        1023)
    if (input.buttonIsPressed(Button.A))}
```
## Display the moisture value numerical value

In the ``||basic:Basic||`` tray, drag the ``||basic:show number||`` block inside the  ``||logic:if true then||`` you previously set. Then, in the ``||pins:Pins||`` tray under the advanced menu option, drag the ``||pins:analog read pin||`` to replace the ``0`` in the ``||basic:show number||`` block.

```blocks
basic.forever(() => {
    led.plotBarGraph(
        pins.analogReadPin(AnalogPin.P0),
        1023)
    if (input.buttonIsPressed(Button.A))
        basic.showNumber(
            pins.analogReadPin(AnalogPin.P0
            ))}
```

## Download your program to the micro:bit

As a reminder, you will need to transfer the updated program to your micro:bit:

1. Connect your micro:bit to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Click the "Download" button.
3. The program will be transferred to the micro:bit and will start running automatically.

## Let's experiment, again!


1. Insert the nails in the dry soil, press **A** and record the value.
2. Insert the nails in the wet soil, press **A** and record the value.

Record your findings. 

The water and nutrients in the soil affect its electrical resistance, which is how much it resists the flow of electricity. The water itself does not carry electricity, but the nutrients in the soil do. The soil behaves like a variable resistor in an electronic circuit. When there is more water and nutrients in the soil, the soil has more conductivity and less electrical resistance.
